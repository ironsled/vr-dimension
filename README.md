WHAT IS VR DIMENSION? AN APPLICATION TO CAPTURE VR DISPLAY FOR VIRTUAL DESKTOP USERS WITHOUT THE NEED TO CAST FROM HEADSET TO STREAM SINGLE VIEW. 
WHY WAS THIS CREATED? I COULD NOT FIND A SOLUTION THAT WAS SATISFACTORY TO USE PREFERRED CODEC OPTIONS WITHOUT TASKING THE VR HEADSET. VR DIMENSION WAS A PROOF OF CONCEPT, FROM IDEA TO REALITY.
